            <p class="first">Accra is the Greater Accra Region's economic and administrative hub, and serves as the anchor of the larger Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA)
                which is inhabited by about 4 million people, making it the thirteenth-largest metropolitan area in Africa. In 2020, the Globalization and World 
                Cities Research Network think tank designated Accra as a "Gamma" level global city, indicating a growing level of international influence and connectedness.

            <p class="first">In the years following World War II, the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods
                 which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. 
                 <br><br> 
                 Thus,the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled shanty-town landscape.
                 <br>
                 Another area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street,
                 forming a massive judicial/administrative complex.
                 <br><br>
                 Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.
                 In 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. <br> Although 
                the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.
                <br><br>
                 Accra is a centre for manufacturing, marketing, finance, insurance, and transportation. 
                    Its financial sector incorporates a central bank, nine commercial banks (with 81 branches), 
                    four development banks (with 19 branches), four merchant banks (with seven branches), 
                    three discount houses, one home finance mortgage bank, multiple building societies, 
                    Ghana Stock Exchange, foreign exchange bureaus, finance houses, insurance companies, insurance brokerage firms,

                    <br><br>

                    two savings and loans companies, and numerous real estate developers, with industrial sites and residential developments.
                 The road network in the Accra Metropolitan Area totals 1,117 kilometres (694 mi) in length.
                    There are over 50,506 identified residential properties in Accra, and about 4,054 commercial/industrial/mixed properties, 
                    with a total rateable value of GH¢13,849,014.[47] There are also supermarkets, 36 facilities for both on–street and 
                    off-street parking,
                    and shopping malls, as well as several facilities for sports and recreation
                    The sectors of Accra's economy consist of the primary, secondary (manufacturing, electricity, gas, water, construction) 
                    and tertiary sectors (supermarkets, shopping malls, hotel, restaurant, transportation, storage, communication, financial intermediation, real estate service, 
                    public administration, education, health and other social services).

                    <br><br>
                    
                 The tertiary service sector is the city's largest, employing about 531,670 people.
                    The second-largest, the secondary sector, employs 22.34% of the labour force, or around 183,934 people. 
                    12.2% of the city's workforce are reportedly unemployed, totalling around 114,198 people
