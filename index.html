             Ghana is a beautiful and diverse country with a rich cultural heritage 
            and a wide range of tourist attractions.  One of the main draws for tourists is the country's stunning coastline, 
            which features a number of beautiful beaches and resorts.  These include Labadi Beach in Accra, Busua Beach in the Western Region, 
             and Kokrobite Beach in the Greater Accra Region.Inland, Ghana has several national parks and nature reserves where visitors can see a wide variety of wildlife, 
            including gorillas, chimpanzees, and birds. These include the Kakum National Park, the Mole National Park, and the Bui National Park.
            Ghana is also home to a number of historical landmarks and cultural festivals. The Cape Coast Castle, 
             which was a major hub of the transatlantic slave trade, is a popular tourist attraction, as is the Ashanti Kingdom's capital, 
             Kumasi. The Panafest and the Homowo Festival are just a few of the many cultural festivals held throughout the year in Ghana. 
          Whether you're interested in history, culture, nature, or just relaxing on the beach, you'll find plenty to see and do in Ghana.
