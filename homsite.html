            <br><br>
            Ghana is a beautiful and diverse country with a rich cultural heritage <br> 
            and a wide range of tourist attractions. <br> One of the main draws for tourists is the country's stunning coastline, <br> 
            which features a number of beautiful beaches and resorts. <br> These include Labadi Beach in Accra, Busua Beach in the Western Region, <br>
                and Kokrobite Beach in the Greater Accra Region.<br><br>

                Inland, Ghana has several national parks and nature reserves where visitors <br> can see a wide variety of wildlife, 
                including gorillas, <br> chimpanzees, and birds. These include the Kakum National Park, the Mole National Park, <br> and the Bui National Park.<br><br>

                Ghana is also home to a number of historical landmarks and cultural festivals. <br> The Cape Coast Castle, 
                 which was a major hub of the <br> transatlantic slave trade, is a popular tourist attraction, as is the Ashanti Kingdom's <br> capital, 
                 Kumasi. The Panafest and the <br> Homowo Festival are just a few of the many cultural festivals held <br> throughout the year in Ghana. 
                 Whether you're interested in history, culture, nature, <br> or just relaxing on the beach, <br> you'll find plenty to see and do in Ghana.
